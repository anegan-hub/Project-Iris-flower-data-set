# Project 2020 - The Iris flower data set 


# Introduction 

The Iris data set or fishers iris data set is a multivariable set introducted by biologist Ronald Fisher in 1939. The use


The data set is based on the 3 species of the Iris Flower and consists of 50 samples of each species: 


     Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. 


The data set contains 5 varaibles; sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species, with 150 rows of data, measured in centimeters. 


It is from the data recorded under the length and width of the sepal and petal that determines the type (species) of the Iris flower.


The dataset is an example of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) which is a method used in statistics,  pattern, recognition, and machine learning to find a linear combination. 

The species Iris Setosa is linearly separable from Iris Versicolor and Iris Versicolor, however these two species are not linear separable, as a portion of Iris Virginica is mixed with Iris Versicolor.

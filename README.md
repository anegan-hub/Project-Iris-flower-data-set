# Project 2020 - The Iris flower data set 


# Introduction 

The Iris data set or fishers iris data set is a multivariable set introducted by biologist Ronald Fisher in 1939. 


The data set is based on the 3 species of the Iris Flower and consists of 50 samples of each species. 


Species: Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor. 


The data set contains 5 varaibles; sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species, with 150 rows of data, measured in centimeters. 


It is from the data recorded under the length and width of the sepal and petal that determines the type (species) of the iris flower.
